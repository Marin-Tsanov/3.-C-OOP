/*
 Define abstract class Human with a first name and a last name. Define a new class Student which is derived from Human and has a new field – grade. 
 Define class Worker derived from Human with a new property WeekSalary and WorkHoursPerDay and a method MoneyPerHour() that returns money earned per hour by the worker. 
 Define the proper constructors and properties for this hierarchy.
 Initialize a list of 10 students and sort them by grade in ascending order (use LINQ or OrderBy() extension method).
 Initialize a list of 10 workers and sort them by money per hour in descending order.
 Merge the lists and sort them by first name and last name.
